This is a Chrome Extension designed to provide theming for Google+.
Right now it only has one theme. 
Sorry.

Install Notes:
1. Save all the files from this repo in a folder somewhere. 
2. In Chrome, go to Wrench Button>Tools>Extensions.
3. In the top right corner, make sure "Developer Mode" is uncollapsed.
4. Click the "Load Unpackaged Extension" button and browse to the folder with this project's files (step 1).
5. Hit OK and enable the extension.
6. Refresh Google+ to see it. It will be active if you see the grey star in the right side of the address bar.
